# Auth0 Lab Hands on Lab: Auth0 as verifier

This repo is for a hands-on lab, found [TODO](todo).

The final completed version of this lab is available in the `end-state` branch of this repo

> :warning: This is a PROOF OF CONCEPT experimental library meant to support the learning of verifiable credentials and has not had a complete security review. As we learn and iterate, please be aware that releases may contain breaking changes.

### Local Verification

If you would like to see a version of this app using local verification, without Auth0, please checkout this repo: 
[auth0-lab/hol-verifier-local](https://github.com/auth0-lab/hol-verifier-local)

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db).
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts) with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).
